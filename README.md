This project is a compact 4-button keyboard designed specifically for productivity shortcuts:

Ctrl+C → Copy
Ctrl+V → Paste
Ctrl+X → Cut
Ctrl+Z → Undo

The idea is to create a dedicated macro pad that simplifies repetitive tasks, 
especially for students, developers, and designers who rely heavily on these shortcuts.
Instead of using a full keyboard, this device offers a minimalist, ergonomic tool that saves time and reduces strain.

You'll need just the custom PCB, which you can find all the schematics and component in the KiCad files and a cable to connect it to the PC obviously.
